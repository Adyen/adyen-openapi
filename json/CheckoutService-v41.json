      "description" : "Adyen Checkout API provides a simple and flexible way to initiate and authorise online payments. You can use the same integration for payments made with cards (including One-Click and 3D Secure), mobile wallets, and local payment methods (e.g. iDEAL and Sofort).\n\nThis API reference provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with them. To learn more about the API, visit [Checkout documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/checkout).\n\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Checkout API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_Checkout_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate a new API Key to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nCheckout API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://checkout-test.adyen.com/v41/payments\n```",
