    "description" : "With the Cloud device API you can: \n* **Send Terminal API requests to a cloud endpoint**. \n  You can use this communication method when it is not an option to send Terminal API requests over your local network directly to a payment terminal.\n* **Check the cloud connection** of a payment terminal or of a device used in a Mobile solution for in-person payments.\n\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Cloud device API must be signed with an API key that has the **Cloud Device API** role. [Generate your API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key) in your test Customer Area and then set this key to the X-API-Key header value. For example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \n-H 'X-API-Key: ADYEN_API_KEY' \n...\n```\n\n## Usage with Terminal API\nWhen using [cloud communications](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/choose-your-architecture/cloud/) for sending and receiving [Terminal API requests](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/terminal-api/latest/overview), your POS system uses the internet to access the cloud and send your Terminal API request to Adyen. Adyen then forwards the request to the payment device. \n\nThe Cloud device API has different endpoints for synchronous or asynchronous cloud communications:\n* If your POS system is designed to keep the connection open to wait for the response, use the endpoints ending in `/sync`.\n\n  In the test environment the endpoint for synchronous communication is `https://device-api-test.adyen.com/v1/merchants/{merchantAccount}/devices/{deviceId}/sync` \n\n* If your POS system is designed to close the connection so that it can initiate a new request, use the endpoints ending in `/async`. \n  You will then receive the Terminal API response asynchronously in an event notification, which is sent as a webhook to an endpoint set up by you.\n\n  In the test environment the endpoint for asynchronous communication is `https://device-api-test.adyen.com/v1/merchants/{merchantAccount}/devices/{deviceId}/async`\n## Going live\nTo access the live endpoints, you must generate a new API key with the **Cloud Device API** role in your live Customer Area. \n\nYou must use the data center and live endpoint that is geographically closest to your location: \n* In your Customer Area, go to **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Select a data center** and select the closest data center. \n* Switch to the live endpoint that is geographically closest to your location. See the base URLs below.\n### Australia:\nhttps://device-api-live-au.adyen.com\n\n### East Asia:\nhttps://device-api-live-apse.adyen.com\n\n### Europe:\nhttps://device-api-live.adyen.com\n\n### United States:\nhttps://device-api-live-us.adyen.com\n\n## Methods",
