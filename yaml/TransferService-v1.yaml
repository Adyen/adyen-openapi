  title: Transfers API
  description: ">Versions 1 and 2 of the Transfers API are deprecated. If you are\
    \ just starting your implementation, use the latest version.\n\nThis API provides\
    \ endpoints that you can use to transfer funds, whether when [paying out to a\
    \ transfer instrument](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/payout-to-users/on-demand-payouts),\
    \ [sending funds to third parties](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/business-accounts/send-receive-funds)\
    \ for users with business bank accounts, or to [request a payout for a grant offer](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/capital).\
    \ The API also supports use cases for [getting transactions for business bank\
    \ accounts](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/business-accounts/transactions-api)\
    \ and getting [grants and its outstanding balances](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/capital#get-balances).\
    \ .\n\n## Authentication\nYour Adyen contact will provide your API credential\
    \ and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API\
    \ key as the value, for example:\n\n ```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\
    \ \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n...\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use\
    \ the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication.\
    \ For example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-U \"ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM\"\
    :\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\" \\\n...\n```\n## Roles and permissions\nTo use the Transfers\
    \ API, you need an additional role for your API credential. Transfers must also\
    \ be enabled for the source balance account. Your Adyen contact will set up the\
    \ roles and permissions for you.\n## Versioning\nThe Transfers API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning)\
    \ using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format:\
    \ \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/btl/v1/transfers\n\
    ```\n## Going live\nWhen going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API\
    \ credential for the live environment. You can then use the username and password\
    \ to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/btl/v1`.\n\n"
