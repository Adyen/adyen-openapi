  title: Notification Configuration API
  description: "This API is used for the classic integration. If you are just starting\
    \ your implementation, refer to our [new integration guide](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms)\
    \ instead.\n\nThe Notification Configuration API provides endpoints for setting\
    \ up and testing notifications that inform you of events on your platform, for\
    \ example when a verification check or a payout has been completed.\n\nFor more\
    \ information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic/notifications).\n\
    ## Authentication\nYour Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an\
    \ API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as\
    \ the value, for example:\n\n ```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\
    \ \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n...\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use\
    \ the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication.\
    \ For example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U \"ws@MarketPlace.YOUR_PLATFORM_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\"\
    \ \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\nWhen going live, you\
    \ need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\
    \n## Versioning\nThe Notification Configuration API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning)\
    \ using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format:\
    \ \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Notification/v2/createNotificationConfiguration\n\
    ```"

      summary: Subscribe to notifications
      description: Creates a subscription to notifications informing you of events
        on your platform. After the subscription is created, the events specified
        in the configuration will be sent to the URL specified in the configuration.
        Subscriptions must be configured on a per-event basis (as opposed to, for
        example, a per-account holder basis), so all event notifications of a marketplace
        and of a given type will be sent to the same endpoint(s). A marketplace may
        have multiple endpoints if desired; an event notification may be sent to as
        many or as few different endpoints as configured.
