  title: Balance Platform Notification Webhooks
  description: 'Adyen sends notifications through webhooks to inform your system about
    events that occur in the balance platform. These events include when a card user
    makes a payment, or when a merchant starts a refund. When an event occurs, Adyen
    makes an HTTP POST request to a URL on your server and includes the details of
    the event in the request body.


    You can use webhooks to build your implementations. For example, you can use the
    information to update balances in your own dashboards or to keep track of incoming
    funds.


    Refer to [Notification webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/issuing/notification-webhooks)
    for more information.'
