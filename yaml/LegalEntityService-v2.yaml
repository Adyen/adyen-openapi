  title: Legal Entity Management API
  description: "The Legal Entity Management API enables you to manage legal entities\
    \ that contain information required for verification. \n## Authentication\nTo\
    \ connect to the Legal Entity Management API, you must use the basic authentication\
    \ credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, contact the [Adyen\
    \ Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Use the web\
    \ service user credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\n\n```\n\
    curl\n-U \"ws12345@Scope.BalancePlatform_YourBalancePlatform\":\"YourWsPassword\"\
    \ \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going\
    \ live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live\
    \ endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n\
    ## Versioning\nThe Legal Entity Management API supports versioning of its endpoints\
    \ through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following\
    \ format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://kyc-test.adyen.com/lem/v1/legalEntities\n\
    ```\n## Going live\nWhen going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API\
    \ credential for the live environment. You can then use the username and password\
    \ to send requests to `https://kyc-live.adyen.com/lem/v1`.\n\n"
