  title: 'Adyen for Platforms: Notification Configuration API'
  description: 'The Notification Configuration API provides endpoints for setting
    up and testing notifications that inform you of events on your platform, for example
    when a KYC check or a payout has been completed.


    For more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/notifications).

    ## Authentication

    To connect to the Notification Configuration API, you must use basic authentication
    credentials of your web service user. If you don''t have one, contact our [Adyen
    Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then use its credentials
    to authenticate your request, for example:


    ```

    curl

    -U "ws@MarketPlace.YourMarketPlace":"YourWsPassword" \

    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    ...

    ```

    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials
    to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).


    ## Versioning

    The Notification Configuration API supports versioning of its endpoints through
    a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX",
    where XX is the version number.


    For example:

    ```

    https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Notification/v1/createNotificationConfiguration

    ```'

      summary: Subscribe to notifications.
      description: Creates a subscription to notifications informing you of events
        on your platform. After the subscription is created, the events specified
        in the configuration will be sent to the URL specified in the configuration.
        Subscriptions must be configured on a per-event basis (as opposed to, for
        example, a per-account holder basis), so all event notifications of a marketplace
        and of a given type will be sent to the same endpoint(s). A marketplace may
        have multiple endpoints if desired; an event notification may be sent to as
        many or as few different endpoints as configured.
