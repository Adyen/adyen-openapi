  title: Raise disputes API
  description: "Disputes API for Issuing that you can use to raise disputes on transactions\
    \ made with an Adyen-issued card. You can also add attachments as supporting information\
    \ for a raised dispute, update information about the dispute, submit the dispute\
    \ for a chargeback, or close the dispute.\n\n## Authentication\nYour Adyen contact\
    \ will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add\
    \ an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:\n\n ```\n\
    curl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\"\
    \ \\\n...\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the username and password to connect\
    \ to the API using basic authentication. For example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type:\
    \ application/json\" \\\n-U \"ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM\":\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\"\
    \ \\\n...\n```\n## Roles and permissions\nTo use the Disputes API, you need an\
    \ additional role for your API credential. Your Adyen contact will set up the\
    \ roles and permissions for you.\n## Versioning\nThe Disputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning)\
    \ using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format:\
    \ \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/btl/api/v{version}/disputes\n\
    ```\n## Going live\nWhen going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API\
    \ credential for the live environment. You can then use the username and password\
    \ to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/btl/api/v{version}`.\n\
    \n"
