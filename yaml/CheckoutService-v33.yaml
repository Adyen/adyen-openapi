  title: Adyen Checkout API
  description: |-
    Adyen Checkout API provides a simple and flexible way to initiate and authorise online payments. You can use the same integration for payments made with cards (including One-Click and 3D Secure), mobile wallets, and local payment methods (e.g. iDEAL and Sofort).

    This API reference provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with them. To learn more about the API, visit [Checkout documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/checkout).

    ## Authentication
    Each request to the Checkout API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:

    ```
    curl
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: Your_Checkout_API_key" \
    ...
    ```
    Note that when going live, you need to generate a new API Key to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).

    ## Versioning
    Checkout API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v33/payments
    ```

Besides giving back a list of the available payment methods, the response also returns which input details you need to collect from the shopper (to be submitted to `/payments`).

        Although we highly recommend using this endpoint to ensure you are always offering the most up-to-date list of payment methods, its usage is optional. You can, for example, also cache the `/paymentMethods` response and update it once a week.

        * For some payment methods (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, and SEPA Direct Debits) you'll get a final state in the `resultCode` (e.g. `authorised` or `refused`).
        * For other payment methods, you'll receive `redirectShopper` as `resultCode` together with a `redirectUrl`. In this case, the shopper must finalize the payment on the page behind the `redirectUrl`.

        Submits details for a payment created using `/payments`. This step is only needed when no final state has been reached on the `/payments` request (for example for 3D Secure, or when getting redirected back directly from a payment method using an app switch).

        The exact details, which need to be sent to this endpoint, are always specified in the response of the associated `/payments` request.

        In addition, the endpoint can be used to verify a `payload`, which is returned after coming back from the Checkout SDK or any of the redirect based methods on the Checkout API.

            Allowed values:
            * **PreAuth** – flags the payment request to be handled as a pre-authorisation.

            Transaction identifier from card schemes, for example, Mastercard Trace ID or the Visa Transaction ID.

            Submit the original transaction ID of the contract in your payment request if you are not tokenizing card details with Adyen and are making a merchant-initiated transaction (MIT) for subsequent charges.

            Make sure you are sending `shopperInteraction` **ContAuth** and `recurringProcessingModel` **Subscription** or **UnscheduledCardonFile** to ensure that the transaction is classified as MIT.

            This is a transient, retriable error since no messaging could be initiated to an issuing system (or third-party acquiring system). Therefore, the header Transient-Error: true is returned in the response. A subsequent request using the same idempotency key will be processed as if it was the first request.
            * **IOEXCEPTION_RECEIVED** – Something went wrong during transmission of the message or receiving the response.
            This is a classified as non-transient because the message could have been received by the issuing party and been acted upon. No transient error header is returned. If using idempotency, the (error) response is stored as the final result for the idempotency key. Subsequent messages with the same idempotency key not be processed beyond returning the stored response.

            * **false** – Not ready to support native 3D Secure 2 authentication. Adyen will not offer 3D Secure 2 to your shopper regardless of your configuration.
            > This parameter only indicates your readiness to support 3D Secure 2 natively on Drop-in or Components. To specify that you want to perform 3D Secure on a transaction, use Dynamic 3D Secure or send the executeThreeD parameter.
