  title: Balance Platform Transfers API
  description: "The Balance Platform Transfers API provides an endpoint that you can\
    \ use to move funds within your balance platform, or to send funds from your balance\
    \ platform to a [transfer instrument](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/balanceplatform/latest/post/transferInstruments).\n\
    \nFor information on how the API is used in Adyen Issuing, refer to [Manage funds](https://docs.adyen.com/issuing/manage-funds#transfer).\n\
    \n## Authentication\nYour Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an\
    \ API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as\
    \ the value, for example:\n\n ```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\
    \ \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n...\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use\
    \ the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication.\
    \ For example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-U \"ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM\"\
    :\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\" \\\n...\n```\n## Roles and permissions\nTo use the Balance\
    \ Platforms Transfers API, you need an additional role for your API credential.\
    \ Transfers must also be enabled for the source balance account. Your Adyen contact\
    \ will set up the roles and permissions for you.\n## Versioning\nThe Balance Platform\
    \ Transfers API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning)\
    \ using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format:\
    \ \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/btl/v1\n\
    ```\n## Going live\nWhen going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API\
    \ credential for the live environment. You can then use the username and password\
    \ to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/btl/v1`.\n\n\
    For more information, refer to our [Going live documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/issuing/integration-checklist#going-live)."
