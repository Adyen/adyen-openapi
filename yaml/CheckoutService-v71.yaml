  title: Adyen Checkout API
  description: "Adyen Checkout API provides a simple and flexible way to initiate\
    \ and authorise online payments. You can use the same integration for payments\
    \ made with cards (including 3D Secure), mobile wallets, and local payment methods\
    \ (for example, iDEAL and Sofort).\n\nThis API reference provides information\
    \ on available endpoints and how to interact with them. To learn more about the\
    \ API, visit [online payments documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments).\n\
    \n## Authentication\nEach request to Checkout API must be signed with an API key.\
    \ For this, [get your API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key)\
    \ from your Customer Area, and set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for\
    \ example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key:\
    \ YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n...\n```\n## Versioning\nCheckout API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning)\
    \ using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format:\
    \ \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://checkout-test.adyen.com/v71/payments\n\
    ```\n\n## Server-side API libraries\nWe provide open-source [server-side API libraries](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/libraries/)\
    \ in several languages: \n- PHP\n- Java\n- Node.js\n- .NET\n- Go\n- Python\n-\
    \ Ruby\n- Apex (beta)\n\nSee our [integration examples](https://github.com/adyen-examples#%EF%B8%8F-official-integration-examples)\
    \ for example uses of the libraries.\n\n## Developer resources\nCheckout API is\
    \ available through a Postman collection. Click the button below to create a fork,\
    \ then set the environment variables at **Environments**&nbsp;>&nbsp;**Adyen&nbsp;APIs**.\
    \ \n\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/25716737-46ad970e-dc9e-4246-bac2-769c6083e7b5?action=collection%2Ffork&source=rip_markdown&collection-url=entityId%3D25716737-46ad970e-dc9e-4246-bac2-769c6083e7b5%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Da8d63f9f-cfc7-4810-90c5-9e0c60030d3e#?env%5BAdyen%20APIs%5D=W3sia2V5IjoiWC1BUEktS2V5IiwidmFsdWUiOiIiLCJlbmFibGVkIjp0cnVlLCJ0eXBlIjoic2VjcmV0In0seyJrZXkiOiJZT1VSX01FUkNIQU5UX0FDQ09VTlQiLCJ2YWx1ZSI6IiIsImVuYWJsZWQiOnRydWUsInR5cGUiOiJkZWZhdWx0In0seyJrZXkiOiJZT1VSX0NPTVBBTllfQUNDT1VOVCIsInZhbHVlIjoiIiwiZW5hYmxlZCI6dHJ1ZSwidHlwZSI6ImRlZmF1bHQifSx7ImtleSI6IllPVVJfQkFMQU5DRV9QTEFURk9STSIsInZhbHVlIjoiIiwiZW5hYmxlZCI6dHJ1ZSwidHlwZSI6ImRlZmF1bHQifV0=)\n\
    \n\n## Going live\n\nTo access the live endpoints, you need an API key from your\
    \ live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique\
    \ to your company account, for example:\n```\nhttps://{PREFIX}-checkout-live.adyenpayments.com/checkout/v71/payments\n\
    ```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** >\
    \ **API URLs** > **Prefix**.\n\nWhen preparing to do live transactions with Checkout\
    \ API, follow the [go-live checklist](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/go-live-checklist)\
    \ to make sure you've got all the required configuration in place.\n\n## Release\
    \ notes\nHave a look at the [release notes](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/release-notes?integration_type=api&version=71)\
