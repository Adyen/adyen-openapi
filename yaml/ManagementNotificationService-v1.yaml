  description: 'Adyen uses webhooks to inform your system about events that happen
    with your Adyen company and merchant accounts, stores, payment terminals, and
    payment methods when using [Management API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/ManagementService/latest/overview).


    When an event occurs, Adyen makes an HTTP POST request to a URL on your server
    and includes the details of the event in the request body.


    See [Webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks) for more
