  title: Adyen Payment API
  description: |-
    A set of API endpoints that allow you to initiate, settle, and modify payments on the Adyen payments platform. You can use the API to accept card payments (including One-Click and 3D Secure), bank transfers, ewallets, and many other payment methods.

    To learn more about the API, visit [Classic integration](https://docs.adyen.com/classic-integration).

    ## Authentication
    To connect to the Payments API, you must use your basic authentication credentials. For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get the WS user password](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-web-service-ws-user-password). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:

    ```
    curl
    -U "ws@Company.YourCompany":"YourWsPassword" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    ...
    ```
    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).

    ## Versioning
    Payments API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payment/v25/authorise
    ```

      summary: Creates a payment authorisation.
      description: |-
        Creates a payment with a unique reference (`pspReference`) and attempts to obtain an authorisation hold. For cards, this amount can be captured or cancelled later. Non-card payment methods typically don't support this and will automatically capture as part of the authorisation.

  /capture:
    post:
      summary: Captures an authorised payment.
      description: |-
        Captures the authorisation hold on a payment, returning a unique reference for this request. Usually the full authorisation amount is captured, however it's also possible to capture a smaller amount, which results in cancelling the remaining authorisation balance.

        Payment methods, which automatically capture as part of authorisation, don't need to be captured, but submitting a capture request on these transactions will not result in double charges. If immediate or delayed auto-capture is enabled, calling the capture method is not neccessary.

Multiple (partial) refunds will be accepted as long as their sum doesn't exceed the captured amount.

            This is a transient, retriable error since no messaging could be initiated to an issuing system (or third-party acquiring system).

            This is a classified as non-transient because the message could have been received by the issuing party and been acted upon. No transient error header is returned. If using idempotency, the (error) response is stored as the final result for the idempotency key.
