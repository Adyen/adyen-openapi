        Allows you to increase or decrease the authorised amount after the initial authorisation has taken place. This functionality enables tipping, improving the chances your authorisation will be valid, charging the shopper when they have already left the merchant premises, etc.

  /capture:
    post:
      summary: Capture a payment authorisation
      description: |-
        Captures the authorisation hold on a payment, returning a unique reference for this request. Usually the full authorisation amount is captured, however it's also possible to capture a smaller amount, which results in cancelling the remaining authorisation balance.

        Payment methods, which automatically capture as part of authorisation, don't need to be captured, but submitting a capture request on these transactions will not result in double charges. If immediate or delayed auto-capture is enabled, calling the capture method is not neccessary.

        Refunds a payment that has previously been captured, returning a unique reference for this request. Refunding can be done on the full captured amount or a partial amount. Multiple (partial) refunds will be accepted as long as their sum doesn't exceed the captured amount. Payments which have been authorised, but not captured, cannot be refunded, use the /cancel method instead.

        > Some payment methods/gateways do not support partial/multiple refunds.
        > A margin above the captured limit can be configured to cover shipping/handling costs.
