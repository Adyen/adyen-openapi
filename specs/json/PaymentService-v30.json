      "description" : "A set of API endpoints that allow you to initiate, settle, and modify payments on the Adyen payments platform. You can use the API to accept card payments (including One-Click and 3D Secure), bank transfers, ewallets, and many other payment methods.\n\nTo learn more about the API, visit [Classic integration](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/classic-integration).\n\n## Authentication\nTo connect to the Payments API, you must use your basic authentication credentials. For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get the WS user password](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/user-management/how-to-get-the-web-service-ws-user-password). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nPayments API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payment/v30/authorise\n```",
